API:
Checking the Feature funtinality of application without UI is called APi 

Checking the Feature funtinality of application without presentation layer is called APi 

If presentation layer is not there then API is acting like a presentation layer for API testing.

Types of API
Communication level API
Coding level API

Communication level API:
The kind of API which exist in the form of webservices

Coding Level API:
The kind of API which exist in the form of jars  

Every jar which we use is one API,which is stored in our GitHub


WebServices:
Whenever two application want to communicate with each other we requre WebServices.

When App. want co commuicate with server we require webServices



Ques-When http can communicate with server why we require Webservices?
->Because http dependencies consumes huge memeory compare to webservices  

TrickQues:
What is difference between API and webSedrvices?

API:  It is used to acess the feature present in server or application
Webservices: It is used to store and transfer the data from one app to another app.

Both API and WebServices are paralley depenedent to each other

URL:
It statnds for Unified resouce locator
  It is a unique indent used to locate reouces in a server
     
    https://www.flipkart.com/

URI:
It statnds for inified reouce identifier
It consist of logical and seqential charcter though which we can reach to end point of the Web Apllication
 
 https://www.flipkart.com/mobile-phones-store?fm=neo%2Fmerchandising&iid=M_a420a30c
 
 URI is written after question mark which is the end point of the WebApplication.


https://www.google.com

https://www.google.com/?gps

Note:
Every API exist in the form of URI but every URI is not the API 


Advantage of APIs:
Reusibility of API is possible
API are platform independent
API helps to communicate between two application
Version updation affet to every aplication

Resouce:
Static WebPage Resource
Dynamic WebPage Resource

Static WebPage Resource:
When user send the request to the server then in response we will get the same data
again and again.

Dynamic WebPage Resouce:
When we send the request to server the response well change every time  is called
Dynamic web Resource..


API can be devloped in two format:
SOAP API
REST API

SOAP API:
It stands for simple object acess protocol.
If api consumes a weservices  devloped in xml language then it is called SOAP API

REST API
IF API consumes the webservices devliped in JSON language then it is called
REST API
It statnds for Representation state transfer..


Advantage of JSON over XML:
1- In XML we can store and transfer the data in String format whereas JSON we
    can store and transfer Object,Array,int,etc
2-XML provides in String dataType whereas JSON provides multiple datatype like
   Array,Object ,String etc
3->XML is complex to understand whereas JSON is easy

4-JSON is faster then XML

What is JSON?
It stands for Java Script ObjectNotation.
It is the advanced version of JavaScript
 "Student" :{
                     "name":"Raja",
                     "rollNum":22,
                     "age": 18,
                      "Sub":"Java",
                       "gender":"Male"    
                   }
            
JSON stores the data in the form of key:value pair
Every key:value pair is seperated by   ','
Every key:value pair is one entry
{ }---->It is considered as an Object
Last entry we never provide the ', '
Key must be always in String format


How to use Array here?

  "Student":{
                       "phone":[12345,322332,32323 ]
 
                 }

[ ] -->It is considerd as an array

        
->Object inside Object is possible  

   "Employee":{
                          "name":"Abhi",
                          "EmpID":223,
                          "sal":1000,
                          "designation":"SAE",
                            "skills":{
		           "manual":"---*",
                                          "SQL":"-*",
                                          "Automation":"--------*",
                                          "JAva":"--*"

                                       }   

                       }
                     

[
    "Stud1":{
                    "name":"A"
                },
   "Stud2":{
                    "name":"B"
                },
   "Stud3":{
                    "name":"C"
                }


]



Conclusion:

Object inside Object---->Valid
Object inside Array--->Valid
Array inside Object---->Valid
Object inside Array---->Valid

Request And Response:

Request:
When client send any work to perform in server is called request..

There are four imporatnt parameters requires in request.
1-URI
2-HTTP methods
3-Content Type
4-Payload Data

1-URI:
https://www.google.com/searcg?q=ipl

https->protocol

www.google.com->Domain Name or server name

search->Resuoce Path

?=ipl
    After question mark what ever we write is  querry String  

What  is Protocol?
When ever two application want to communicate with each they requre 
some rules and regulation to communicate with each other.

Or 

It is a agrement though which two application can comunicate with other


There are two most frequently used  protocol
https
http


Server:
 It will take the request from the client and it will reach to the webaplication
and it will perform the opertion and return back to the client

Resource Path:
It is a perticular path to acess the required webresource present in server

It starts after  '/' and before '?'

Resouce path we can also say as module or feature name

Querry String:
It is a sequece of charecter which provide required information


HTTP methods:
It is a compulsory paramter  in request header.
->HTTP methods decide what type of work request need to perform in
    server.
There are following HTTP methods which we use
1->GET
2->POST
3->PUT
4->Patch
5->Delete

1->This method is used to fetch the data from server
       example Indigo flight search
2->POST-The method is used to add or insert data inm server.
     Example:Booking the flight with required information
3->Delete- This method will delete the data from server
4->PUT->PUT means update the data fully in the server

5->PATCH->It means update the data partially inside the server




ContentType:
It is not compulsary parameter for request
Beacuse get and delete method do not requre content to send whereas 
post,put,patch requres content

In content tyep we send some data that needs to be written in server

PayLoad:
What type of actual data in KB,MB or GB we send the data to server 

Response:

Status Code:
It is the indication of server weather server perform the request in proper
way or not acording to the request

100
200
300
400
500

100-:[101,102,103,......110]
This status code we get when request is not reach to the server..
Example:
             10 or 12 result

200:[201,202,203....210]
The task alloted to server is sucessfully done then we get 200 series ststus code


300:[301,302,303....]
We get 300 ststuc code when there is involment of two or more server and the first server
is responding while the other is not reponding.

400:[401,402,403]
When there is any spelling mistake or internet issue then we get 400 series
ststus codes...

500:[501,502,503....]
We get 500 ststus code series when request is reching to the server but
server is not reponding...

Note:
100 and 300 we will get rearly mainly we will deal with 200,400 and 500
ststus code



Now lets Strat Acutal API testing:
Why we neeed nodeJS?
It will provide the free API for testing

How to install nodeJS:
In google type nodejs download
Click on the first link
Click on windows installer .msi file
Go to the download and keep the downloded nodeJS in seperate folder.
Perform normal installation steps....

How to check wether nodeJS is installed or not?
Go to cmd prom

node --version

After installation of NodeJS we have to go npm Lib:

npm lib automatically install with nodejs

To get the free API we require json server also:
Json server is same as real time server so we will also json server

Now we will download JSON server using npm::
Go to the cmd prom where we pasted the NodeJS and type the command
  npm insall -g json-server     ->It will install json server in my system

Now to install JSON-server we type the following command in cmd prom

         json-server --watch db.json



Can we acess API through browser?
Yes we can but it is not recomended because we can not perform any execution
or validation here.


Why Postman is needed to test the API?

1->Beacuse it will provide the http methods
2->Here we can perform the validation of response
3-here we perfrom multiple excution
4->Cache memory never creates a issue

How to install postman in system?

Go to google type postman download
then click on first link
Click on 64 bit of postman


How to use PostMAn:
Step1:
Create a workSpace by providing the proper name
Stpe2:
Create a Collection(Here project is called as Collection)
 Create a collection by clicking on Create new Collection by providing the name
Step3:
Create a folder(Which is similar to package in ecllipse)
 
To create folder  we will click on three dots of collction and click on new foder

Step4:
Create a request which we need to perform in our server
 to create request we need to click on three dots of folder and click on ADD request


http methods utilization:
Get:
To use Get methods we require only url ,which we will copy and paste

Post:
->To use Post method we require url as well as content which we need to write in BODY.
->Click on body then click on Raw ->Then click on JSON

Put:
->To use put method we require url as well as content which we need to write in BODY.
->Click on body then click on Raw ->Then click on JSON
->We require end point to update the data     

Delete:
To use Delete methods we require only url ,which we will copy and paste
And also we requre end points


Validation of Response:

There are multiple validation present in API:
We need to valiadte the 

Status code
Headers
Cookies
ResponseTime
ResponseBody


So to perform validation  or assertioni n postman we require
  pm-library and also require JavaScript methods


The Lib here called as Chai Assertion lib if we want to perform validation
                                     -------------------

Here there two waus to the javaScript funtions
1-Normal Funtion
2-Arrow Funtion

1-Normal Funtion
         
            pm.test("TestName",funtion()
                         {
                              assertion
                         }
            );

2-Arrow Funtion
        
              pm.test("TestName",() =>
                                         {
            		         assertion
                                         }
                     
);
         
Validation of Status Code:

pm.test("Validate StatusCode",function()
      {
        pm.response.to.have.status(200)
      }

);

Validation og Response Time:
pm.test("Response time is less than 200ms", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(200);
});

This all methods will be present in snippets of PostMan

Now We will validate the headers:
Note:
We can validate the ststic content only like date,time can not be validated 
because they are dynamic content 

Check that perticular key is present in header or not?

pm.test("Content type header is present",()=>
   {
     pm.response.to.have.header("Content-Type")
   }
);

pm.test("Pragma and ContentLength is present",()=>{
    pm.response.to.have.header("Pragma")
    pm.response.to.have.header("Content-Length")
});


Validation of Given Value in Headers:

pm.except("ContentType Header Validation")



pm.test("Content-Type header Validation",()=>{

   pm.expect(pm.response.headers.get("Content-Type"))

   .to.eql("application/json; charset=utf-8")
   
});

pm.test("Pragma Validation in Headers",()=>{

   pm.expect(pm.response.headers.get("Pragma")).to.eql
   ("no-cache")



});


Now we will Validate the Response Body:
------------------------------------------------
So here we will create our own Json File in notepad 
and We will give the extension as .json..

{
     "Stud1":{
  		"id":1,
 		 "name":"Raja",
 		"phone":"21211",
  		"courses

":["Java","Selenium"]
                 }
}

To validate the body we first store the response in one variable..

const jsonData=pm.response.json();//Storing the response Body in one variable
console.log("Hello");//It will print the data in our console

console.log("Json Body Response"+jsonData);

pm.test("Validation Of JsonBody is Object",() =>{
 
  pm.expect(jsonData).to.be.an("Object");

});
pm.test("Validation of Id is number",()=>{
   pm.expect(jsonData.id).to.be.a("number");

});

pm.test("Validation of name is String",()=>{
   pm.expect(jsonData.name).to.be.a("String");

});
pm.test("Validation of Id is number",()=>{
   pm.expect(jsonData.id).to.be.a("number");

});
pm.test("Validation of Courses is Array or not",()=>{
   pm.expect(jsonData.courses).to.be.an("Array");

});

note:
const is data dataType same Var is also a DataType to store data
-----                                         ----
Now we will Validate the JsonBody Key value  data::

const jsonData=pm.response().json();

pm.test("validation of Value in ResponseBody", () => {

     pm.expect(jsonData.id).to.eql(1)
     pm.expect(jsonData.name).to.eql("Raja")
     pm.expect(jsonData.phone).to.eql("21211")
     pm.expect(jsonData.courses[0]).to.eql("Java")
     pm.expect(jsonData.courses[1]).to.eql("Selenium")



    
});

Chaining process in PostMAn:
Running all your request Simultaniously is called as chaining process
In chaning process we can see all the test Output pass or fail

How to perform it?
Click on three dots of collection
We will click on run Collection
Here we can provide the itaration and delay
and then click on Run

pre-requesite
First pre-reqisite script will execute then Request then Response and in last
tests will ececute


There are three level in this
Collection level
Folder level
Request level

Variables in PostMan:
Global VAriable
Environment Variables
Collction variable
Local variable

Global Variable:
If we declare any variable as global then we can acess it anywhere within 
in a same workspace..

Environment Variable:
http://localhost:3000dev/posts
int x=20;
http://localhost:3000qa/posts
int x=30
http://localhost:3000pro/posts
int x=0

Acess through perticuler workspace but we need to switch perticalr 
environment



Practise

Complex Json :
If we get compex json then finding path is trick so we must use here JSON path finder tool

How to find JSON path finder tool:
Go to google and type JSON path Finder tool
                                        -------------------------
Copy the json Script and paste  in tool and go to the perticular key..

Note:
We should never copy x from path
                                      ---


Authentcation and  Authorizaruion:

Authentication means providing proper credential to login to the application amd check wether user exist or not

Autorization means after authentication provideing the access to the perticular user in Application is called
Authorazation

There are multiple Authoration in our postman:
1-No auth
2-API key
3-Bearer Token
7-Basic Auth
4-Digest Auth
5-OAuth 1.0
6-OAuth 2.0


->No Auth:
There is no Auth for this API

->API key
In this devlipers will provide the key and value which we will
provide in our API key
->Basic Auth:For this we will get username and password to 
    acess the API..
    https://postman-echo.com/basic-auth
     
    usename:postman
    password:password


Digest Auth:
Disest Auth is similar to basic  Auth only the difference is for
Encryption 
In Basic Auth data is not encrypted where as in Digest Auth
Data is Encrypeted
Here also we reqire UN and PWD

OAuth 1.0:
This typy of Authorization is used for high Security

Here we need to provide the Consumer Key, Consumer secret,Acess token and Acess secret


CRUL and Swagger:

Swagger:

It is a intractive document
Intractive document means it is a non static document in which we update and also we can execute the APIs
Swagger document is going to prepared by Devlopers
Swagger we can say also as a tool in which Document is prepared


D/f between swagger and postman:
Swagger is used to exlorer the API but postman is used to test the API for testing
Swagger we can not put any validation but in postman we can perform validation
Swagger we can not save the result but in postman we can save the result...

Note:
After devloping the API devlopers will share the swagger Document


CURL:Client URL
When we will excute the API form swagger then we will get Curl in response

What is CURL?
It is a consolidated data in which we will have body,parameter,URI,url

Copy the curl and paste in  postman
In postman go to import and paste the Curl

If we paste the curl no need to provide the url,uri,parameter,body 

Genration Random Numbers:

const randNum=Math.floor(Math.random()*1000+1);
console.log(randNum)

Generate Random String:
var randStr="John"+Math.random().toString(36).substring(2);
console.log(randStr);

In Post We given body as

{
  "id":{{id}},
  "username": "{{un}}",
  "firstName": "{{fn}}",
  "lastName": "{{ln}}",
  "email": "{{email}}",
  "password": "{{pwd}}",
  "phone": "{{phNum}}",
  "userStatus": {{us}}
}

const randNum=Math.floor(Math.random()*1000);
console.log(randNum)

var randStr="John"+Math.random().toString(36).substring(2);
console.log(randStr);

pm.environment.set("id",randNum);
pm.environment.set("un",randStr);
pm.environment.set("fn",randStr);
pm.environment.set("ln",randStr);
pm.environment.set("email",randStr+"@gmail.com");
pm.environment.set("pwd","12121");
pm.environment.set("phNum","123443");
pm.environment.set("us",0);

How to Run the request in Command prom::

To run in command we reqirer the tool NewMan tool

Reqrirement for newMan is NodeJs +npm must install:

How to install newman:
open cmd prom
npm install -g newman

How to Excute Collection in cmd Prom:
My collection is not present in my System so to transfer Collection in my System following Steps reqired
->Click on the three dots of collection
->click on Export
->Select the recomended version of Collection and Click on Export 
->Now save the file in your System in .json extension...

Now Steps to excute the .json File in our System,

Open the cmd Prom Where we saved the File
Write the cmd
  newman run Filename.json

How we can genrate the report of our Request:

First we need to install reporter.html

npm install -g newman-reporter-html

Now open the cmd prom and type the code to genrate the report

newman run Filename.json -r html     

We will get the Folder where report will be present



Rest Assured
It is used to verify the API with the help of java Lib
Java lib will act like headless in which we will send the request and
we will get response
With the help of Rest Assured we can handle the http methods,responses,
Ststus Code,Status time, etc

Pre requisute of Rest Assured:
Maven
Java 11 
TestNG

Dependencies reqired for Rest Assured:
->rest assured
->json-path
->json
->gson
->testNG
->JavaFaker
->Jackson-DataBind


Rest Assured have many http methods
Get,Post,Delete,Put(mainly)

Rest Assured follow Gherkins language of Cucmber

given() 
when() 
then()

given()->It is a precondition before sending the request 
                content-type,add  auth,add param etc

when()->Here we provide the http methods
                 Get,Post,Put,Delete

then()->
         Validation status code,extract the response,extract response body
           It can be used for multiple validation
Note:
If we will try import then it will not import beause it requires static Import
To get static import we need to go Google and type Rest Assured Documentation 
then Click on the first link
Scroll down and click on getting started 
Then copy the static import and paste in your class
All the packeges which we copy paste must be ststic

import static io.restassured.RestAssured.*;
import static io.restassured.matcher.RestAssuredMatchers.*;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;


@Test(priority = 2)
	public void getSingleUser()
	{
		given()

How to perticular Id which is created at the Time of Execution:

public class FetchId {
	int idnum;
	@Test(priority = 1)
	public void createUser()
	{
		//To store data we will use HashMap beacause it stores the data in the form of Key and Value
		HashMap hm = new HashMap();
		hm.put("name","tom");
		hm.put("Job","Triner");
	  idnum=	given()
		.contentType("application/json")
		.body(hm)
		.when()
		 .post("https://reqres.in/api/users")
		 //It will store the id of jsonBody
		 .jsonPath().getInt("id");
	  System.out.println(idnum);
}	
//After fetching the id we can use it as a End point of the request..

How to fetch the data from External File and Create the data:




How to pass the querry parameter and path parameter?

->qureey paramter and path parameter is given pre-requisite
->pathParamter we specify with single Curly braces in URI
->Both querryParameter and pathparameter we can provide the data in Key:Value pair
->If we provide the querry parameter and pathParameter then data 
    we send automatically at the time of
    Request(Data is not hard Coded)
   https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2&id=5
    
  pathParam 
   users 
   
   queeryParameter
     Page=2
     id=5


How to validate the cookies and headers:

In validation of cookies and headers somtimes they are dynamic so 
if it is dynamic we need to fetch at the execution..

If we Want to fetch Multiple values of cookies:
@Test
	public void multipleCookiesHandle()
	{
		Response res= given()
		
		.when()
		.get("https://www.google.com/");
		
		  Map<String,String> mulcookies= res.getCookies();
		 //if we want to print all the keys of your map then we use .keyset();
		 System.out.println(mulcookies.keySet());
		 for(String k:mulcookies.keySet())
		 {
			 System.out.println(res.getCookie(k));
		 }
		  
		
		
		
	}

Validation of Headers:
Validation of headers whicle providing direct headers value
@Test
	public void m1()
	{
		given()
		  .when()
		  .get("https://www.google.com/")
		  
		  .then()
		  //Single Validation
		  .header("Content-Type","text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1")
		  .and()
		  .header("Content-Encoding","gzip")
		  
		  .log().all();
          }



Validating Single headers by Response

	@Test
	public void m1()
	{
	   Response res=	
			   given()
		  .when()
		  .get("https://www.google.com/");
		  
		  String hedValue=  res.getHeader("Content-Type");

		  System.out.println(hedValue);
		  Assert.assertEquals(hedValue,"text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1");
		  
		  Reporter.log("Content type validation Done");
		  
		  }


Note:Cookies store the data in Map in the form of Key and value pair whereas Headers
Store the data in Headers Datatype the  form Key and Value

Print All the headers And Validate:

@Test
	public void m1()
	{
	   Response res=	
	                   given()
		  .when()
                                .get("https://www.google.com/");
	       //Headers is a datatype which stores all the headers of response
	       Headers myhed=  res.getHeaders();
	       
	     //Here we used getName and getvalure to print the key and value of headers
                      for(Header h:myhed)
	      {
	    	  System.out.println(h.getName() +" "+h.getValue());
	      }
		  

		  
	}


Validation Of Body in response:

First we will see how how to validate single body in "then" section

@Test
	public void singleDataValidate()
	{
		given()
		
		.when()
		 .get("http://localhost:3000/store")
		 
		.then()
		  .statusCode(200)
		  .body("book[2].title",equalTo("Sayings of friction"))
		  
		  .and()
		  
		  .body("book[1].author",equalTo("Abhi1"));
		 
		 
		 
		 
	}


Validation of Body using varaiables:
Sometimes we will have a typical scnerio in which we will first store the data 
then we need to validate
So to validate more effective way we will use varables
varaibles store is more preferd bacause we can resuse in future and
we can perform addtional validation
@Test
	public void m1()
	{
		Response res= given()
		
		.when()
		
		.get("http://localhost:3000/store");
		//It will print the value of Body in response
		System.out.println(res.jsonPath().get("book[0].category"));
		
		//We are going to store the value of response
		String data= res.jsonPath().get("book[0].category").toString();
		String name= res.jsonPath().get("book[2].author").toString();
		Assert.assertEquals(data,"reference");
		Assert.assertEquals(name,"Abhi2");
		Assert.assertEquals(res.jsonPath().get("book[2].price").toString(),"1500.5");
		
		Assert.assertEquals(res.getHeader("Content-Type"),"application/json; charset=utf-8");
		
}

How to fetch all the title from thar perticular Json Response?

Sometimes we will get the scenario that we need to validate from all the values
then we will fetch all the values by providing key

How to fetch all the values:
Store the response in Response refrence variable
Then Check the response is JsonObject or JsonArrray and acording to it create
the Object
In Object pass asString() because we need to convert response into String

Then again follow your jsonbody Response and use the forloop and Procede further


Note:

   then()
  
   if I do log.headers()->It will provide only headers
   if I do log.body()->It will provide only body
   if I do log.all()->It will provide full response
   if I do log.cookies()->It will provide only cookies

Serialization And Deserialization:

Serialization -->Java(Pojo)----->json
Seserialization-->Json  --->Java


Serializtion:Coverting java into json is called Serialization

To perform serialization we have to go for ObjectMapper class which
we need to create the Object
we also used the not static method that is
writerWithDefaultPrettyPrinter().writeValueAsString(pj)

Deserialization:
Coverting json in java is called as deserilization.
Yo perform deserilization we will go for ObjectMapper class in whic we will
Create Object of it
Then we will go for non ststic method readValue(From where to read,where to pass that Data)

Authoraization:
There are multiple Authrization present in Rest Assured

Basic Auth:
DigestAuth:
PrimitiveBasic  Auth->Combination of both Basic and Digest is called 
as Primitivebasic Auth
It provides more secyrity then Digest Auth
Here also we require Un and pwd

All the above authorization were based on username and password

Every API which is desigen it will have there own Authorization

If the API are very complex and high Security is there then we go for
Auth 1.0,2.0



If the API is present in Github then Github genrates token  which token we
will use our script and we can utilize it
If we want to use it then we will go for Bearer Token authoration


OAuth1:
It is used in more complexity and for secured API
In OAuth1 we will get consumer key,Consumer secret code,Acess Token,Token Secret

OAuth2:

Here only we require acess token

Project:
We go for framework beacuse java executes line by line so our
test Cases will  be dependent so to change the execution flow we 
for framework

Rules to design FW
Data sholud be never Hard Coded
If any reusibility of data or block or methods are there then we keep in 
one place and we will use it multiple times.

What type of data we keep in property file?
The dara which is common through out the project we keep in 
property file..
Data is kept in key value pair


Why we keep the data in Propert file only?
Property file is more preferef bacause it is lighter in weight...


Disadvantag of property file?

Data is not organised in sequential manner...

Where we keep our test Data?
Data which is specific to only test Cases is called test Data
Like ->Organisation name
Contact Name
Test Data I have kept in excel Sheet...
Excel sheet Stores the data in Row and Column(cell) wise
Here Data is stored in well Organised manner.
Disadvantage of Excel:
Data will be slow compared to Propety File..

POM:Object repositary or Element repositary
It is used to store collection of webElement
Automation rule says no data must be hard coded, so locators are stored
in specific resouces like excel,property,Pom class...

So store the locators in pom class so that data is not hard coded..


Difference between  POM class and PageFactory class ?
Pom  is java design pattern,where we will maintain all WebElement
locator in organised way

PageFactory is a extended version of POM class in which we will use
initElements method which is used to initialize the Webelement with 
respect to driver...

SalteElement Refrence exception can be handfled by using
@FindBy
@FindBys
@FindAll

Difeerence between @FindBy, @FindBys,@FindAll?
@FindBy 
It will handle the single element as well as multiple element.
Single element if we handle we have to use WebElement
Multiple  element if we handle then we have to use List<WebElement>

@FindBys:
It is similar to 'and 'operator
@FindBys({@FindBy(locator="value"),@FindBy(locator='value')}))

@FindAll
It is similar to OR operator
@FindAll({@FindBy(locator="value"),@FindBy(locator='value')}))

Advantage of Pom class
It is Perfect for Agile ->It can handle freqent changes
All the element are stored Page Wise so that easily maintained
No external lib requred


Note:
Every Pomclass must end with Page  -> LoginTest
Every test case must end with Test..Tc1  ->Tc1Test
































































 















































 







































Deserilization:Converting Json into java is Deseriliaztion.











VtigerProject:
Generic Utilies/Genric LIb/Genric_Utils
This is a package created in src/main/java
It is used to store all genric class
In this we store multiple methods which are not hardcoded
Whatever methods we write must be in parameters if they want
any data from user end
If it is fetch any data or producing the data then it must have return type.
return type isdeceded on based on method
