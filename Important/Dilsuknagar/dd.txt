 RestAssured Framework Devlopment:
----------------------------------------
Framework:
Here we will maintain different url,different pojo class
reusable component,Maintianablity,test Cases,Readebility...

Maintain all project related files
Objective of framework:
----------------------------
1)Re-usability
2)Maintainiblity
3)Readability

SO we will go for Hybrid fw
                              -----------
Different phases of FW:
1)Userstanding requirement
     ->Funtinal spicification(static document)
      ->Swagger
  The above two will be present before staring the FW:

2)Choose automation  tool(It is library)->Rest Assured lib we will use

3)Design the FW(folder structure,design)

4)Devlopment

5)Excution +CI

 swagger document is neded to start automation FW


Initially I will go for user module latter i will go for
store and pet module..

Here we need to have manual test cases then we
go for automation

So here I will Go for user in petstire URL and we will take
GET,PUT,DELETE,POST for {username}

Here we will prepare the API test cases and this test cases we write
according to the swagger document
Note:First all the test cases must be executed with postMan tool then Go
for Rest Assured..


Design of FW:
   
In my framework was devided into three parts

Devlopment

Exection

Ci/CD


In devlopment part I was having
End Point->Routes,UserEndPoint
Test Cases->UserTests
Payloads->POJO
Utilities->DataProvider,XL Utility ExtentReport
Test Data->UserData.xlsx,StoreData,xlsx,PetData.xlsx

Execution:
TestNG.xml
pom.xml
Reports

CI/CD:
Git
GitHUb
Jenkins



Lets Create the Project Structure:





EndPoint:
In endpoint we are keepping class with seperate URL 
We will create one class as Routes in which I will Keep URL
Rest other classes is for EndPoints
Every Model URL differnt class
Write the implementaion
In this  just use  'then' validation


Exexution:
Payload is for data...POJO approch
Utilities:
DataProvider
Extent Report
