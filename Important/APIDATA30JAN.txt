How to add Random String  in java Script?

var rendomMath.ramdom().toString(36).substring(2);

var useremail ="jim"+random+"@gmail.com";

var username="jim" +random;

pm.environment.set("email_env",useremail);
pm.environment.set("name_env",username);

Now use the environment variable in Post request
{

"name":"{{name_env}}",
 "gender":"male",
 "email":"{{email_env}}",
  "status":" inactive"
}  
Send the request we will get different differnt emailID and name
So every time we will get new 	ID so we have to store the ID in Tests

 var jsonData=JSON.parse(responseBody);
 pm.environment.set("userid_env".jsonData.id);
Now use this ID in other request as Get,Delete,Put.. 

Now we need to compare wetther Get and POST data are same or not So we will compare

So Get response whatever we are getting must be equal to what ever we pass in POST request. 


Now We will go to Get and click on Tests

Here we will get the response body of JSON  to validate between JSON fields and response..

pm.test("value of JSON fields",() =>{
pm.except(jsonData.id).to.eql(pm.environment.get("userid_env"));
pm.except(jsonData.email).to.eql(pm.environment.get("useremil _env"));



}

};
Now same We go for PUT so in put we need to update so again we will go to pre-request and we will send 
the same data which we send in POST i.e genrated variable same this we will go here
No execute the Entire Collection we will get every thing pass...

Now we need to delete all the variables from environment variable...

pm.environment.unset("userid_env");
pm.environment.unset("email_env");
pm.environment.unset(name_env);
