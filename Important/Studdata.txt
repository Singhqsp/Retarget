                         Important Notes
Why we go for frameWork?
We go gor framework because java exexutes line by line so our testcases will become constant
whearas framwork is not excuting lne by line so,Test cases are not dependent 

What is DataDriven Testing?
DataDrivin testing :Fetching the data in external resource like propertyfile,
xlsx.file,.xml,.json, and reading the data in a test script without hardcoding 
is called datadrivin.

 Why should i keep data in Property file?
  We keep the comman data in property file like url,username,password
    browser name.
  ->Property file is more preferd because it is light weight
  ->Property file stores the data in key value pair
 ->Easy to read the data
 ->Disadvantage->Not well organised in seqential manner.

Where we keep the test Data?
Test Data:
   Data which is specific to only test case Like
   Create Organisation->Organisation name
   Create contact ->contact name
  
   To store the test data we prefer excel sheet
   Excel sheet stores the data in the form of rew and column
   Data is stored in well organised way so that data retrival becomes easy
   Data maintanece is easy.
  
  Disadvantage of excel
  Data is slow compared to property file.

  Lets create the Test Data in excel sheet:
  
  For every module we are going to create seperate sheets



Generic Utilities/Generic Library/Generic Utils
  
  ->This ia a package created in src/main/java source folder
  ->It is used to store all generic classes
  ->Method returned in generic  classes should not be hardcoded,they should be generic
  ->What ever data we write in generic should be parameterised
 ->When we call this method should return the scnario action
  ->Based on generic method to return the type of generic method is decided.


Advantage
   Code will be optimized
   No need to remember th syntax of web Actions..
   No need to add the repetative codes again and again.
   Lines Optimized 
   Debugging is easy
   Script Maintenece is easy
 
..Generic lib is common for all Project,
When MTE is  Writing document ATE will devlop the framework according to CRS
GenericLib methods are getRandomNumber(),getDate(),handleDropDown() etc...

So the generic methods which i have created are
Java specific methods: JavaUtility--->C
Property Specific methods :FileUtility--->C
Excel Specific methods:ExcelUtility--->C
Constants-->Iconstant-->I

POM
StaleElemetException:-> Stale  means  old
Our page is refresh then then driver is not refresh

@FindBy ->It is used to identify the element

How to avoid stale element exception?
We are not using driver refrence to fetch the adress istead of that we are using annotaions...

Object Repositary/Element Repostary
It is a collection of WebElement. and their locators
It is devloped by using POM design pattern..
Automation rule says data should be not hardcodded hence all the locators
 are  stored in spcific resource

Every script should have a author

We should never depend  another script

If anywhere is there precondition then first we will only create the procondition

the we will delete the existing pre Condition. 

If I want latest depency of any verion then I can go with::
<version>latest</version>

What us POM?
It is a design pattern prefferd in google to devlop the object repositary.
It is also called as Object repositary /Element repositary.
Its a collection of webelement and there locators
Automation rule says data should not be hard coded so all the locators are 
stored in spscific resources like excel sheet,Properties file or POM class..
So Object repositary are devloped by using POM class...

If locators are not hard coded ,then no need to identify the same element 
multiple times
  ->Many of the times there is frequent changes in UI ,modification of locater
      becomes easy....
Test script will be more optimised and it will work faster...
->Readble easily

WHY POM?
It is well structured design pattern,where we maintain all the webelement
page wise hance modification/maintanece of element becomes easy..

Rules to declare POM class::
Create seperate java class  for web page
Class name should be same as webpage name,,
Do not use driver element to identify the element,Identification is dene by
@FindBy,@FindBys,@FindAll
Create the constructor to initialize all the webelement..
  Inside the constructor we will use PageFactory.inItElements();
Provide the getter and setter methods to acess the elements..
WE can provide reusable bussiness lib.... 



Difference between POM and PageFactory design pattern?
->POM is a java design pattern,where we will maintain all the web Element
    locators in a organised manner.
 ->Pagefactory is a extended design pattern of POM which has a methods 
     called inItElement which is used to initialize  the  webElement with respect
     to driver when the object is created. 
What is staleElementRefrence Exception?
->Basically Its a selenium exception,When ever we try to identify an elent
    the element will be available gor GUI,but at the time of execution,the 
    element will not be recorgnised due to page got refreshed or refrence may 
    be old,or element is no longer available in DOM,In all these cases we get
    stale Element Exception...

  How POM will handle  StaleElementException?
  POM design patern will not identify the elements with webdriver refrence ,instead it uses 
  @FindBy,@FindBys or @FindAll to identify tht elements
  All identified element will get initialises wirh driver refrence only by creating the object,
  hence updated driver refrence is used to initialize.

 Difference between @FindBy ,@FindBys ,@FindBys
  ->All are selenium anotations
  ->@FindBy(locator="value")
          It is used to identify one element at a time,one locator one element
  
  ->@FindAll({@FindBy(locator="value"),@FindBy(locator="value")})
          It is used as OR operator(either this or that)
         
         @FindAll is used for Auto healing process
          Autohealing process is sa process where if the element is not identified
          with one locator during execution it will try to identify for another locator..
    

    ->@FindBys({@FindBy(locator="value"), @FindBy(locator="value")})
       Similar to and operator

Advantage of POM class?
->Helps to maintai the Object repositary in the well organised manner
->Perfect fit foe agile process to handle frequent UI changes..
->All the elements are stored page wise hence maintainece and modification is easy.
 ->Pom uses Encapsulation
 ->No external resouces like library

Note:
classNamePage ended with Page->It is  POM class 
classNameTest ended with Test->It is Test Script

@Test anotation
 It derives the test script excution hence framework is called TDD framework.

Test class name and Test method name should end with Test...

TestClass name is module 
Test Method name is usually testCases.

BaseClass:
Single Base Class acts like a parent and all the test script acts as a individual childs
Hence the class follows Heirarchical Inheritence

Explain Inheritence with respect to your framework?

=>We used inheritence in base class which acts like heirchical inher... where Base class
   contains all the confiuration with anootation acts like Parent clss and all the TS
   should extend from Base class tpo utilize the funtinality given in Base class..

Advantage of BaseClass::
Code usibility
Test Script is optimised
Test Script devlopment is faster
Code maintanece and modifucation is easy
Debuging is easy. 

Batch Excution::Excuting all the test script one after another,sequentially is call Batch Excution
It is alse called Full Regresion testing..
 It is preferd for full regression testing i.e when we can not identify 
  the impacted area
  80% application is affecting
All the TS are loaded inside the suite xml file..

Default excution order for every class is Alphebetical


How to perform Cross browser Excution /compatiility testing?
Choose the test script which have to executed in multiple browser
create a seperate suite xml file and choose parallel mode as test and thread count is required.

Listners:
ITestListner
I present in testNG
I will monitor the test script
I will monitor the various events in test script excution
and perform the relevent information...

onStart----start the excution(suite)
onFinish->Finish the excution
onTestStart-->Test script excution start(@Test)

Who is going to tell that my test case pass,fail or skipped?

ItestResult->It will capture the run time status of test scrtpt methods.. 

     
Note:
result.getThrowable().toString();
This method providres the msg of Exception..


Reports:
TestNg supprt high level HTML report
 The report which is genrated by TestNG do not have barcode
   No grafical reprsentaion
   No pii chart is there
   In this we can not append the SceenShot 
So to overcome we will go for third party tool
like
->Extent report
>Allure report  
For the above reports we need to configure it...
 
Report are the proof for excution which is given to customer
as well as devloper
And also report will help in debugging

Extent Report
For this we need third party tool 
AvenStact extent report
Here we will mainy moniter in BaseClass and Listner Implementation class.

ExtentSparkReporter:(C)
This class will help to configure the location of report..
Basic setting also can be done like document title,report name,document colour..

Extent Reports:(C)
It is used for Basic system info..

ExtentTest->(C)
It will monitor perticular test Script

It will log the status to test Script..

Go to maven and search for  extentreports

click on avnstack->Add the dependency to pom.xml...

Go to Listner class
Go to onStart method
onStart() ->means starts of suite excution

Write inside method
Create the object
ExtendSparkReporter in method then pass the folder path
by creating new project

How to pass the path?
".\\ExtentReports\\Report-"+DataMethod call+".html"

So my report will be saved inside ExtentReports

now using refrence variable ExtentSparkReporter we can modify the reports
ExtentSpartReporter htmlReport = new ExtentSpartReporter(".\\ExtentReports\\Report-"+ dateMethodcall"+".html");

htmlReport.config().setDocumentTitle("V-Tiger Excution Report");
htmlReport.config().setTheme(Theme.DARK);
htmlReport.config().setReportName("Excution Final Report");

Now Create ExtentReport object and set the attachment and  SystemInfo::

ExtentReports re = new ExtentReports();//Declare it Global
By using refrence variable of ExtentReports we will call the non Satatic methods like
re.attactReporter(refrence _variable_of EctentSparkReporter);
//Provide the static info.about the system in Key value pair..
re.attachReporter("Base-Browser","Chrome");
re.attachReporter("Base-Platform","Windows");
re.attachReporter("Base-Host","8888");
re.attachReporter("Reporter-Name","ABhi");



Now go to onFinish()::
Just flush the data(make re global)
re.flush();It will consolidate all the test Script excution and dubp the status in report


Now go to onTestStart()
Works with @Test Anotation  
Create one global variable where ExtentTest is a class and give variable name test

ExtentTest test; 
{
  String methodName=result.getMethod().getMethodName();
  test=report.createTest(methodName);//test is created which will initialize the indivudual test 
}

Go to on test sucess and log the statis of test case
onTestSuccess()
{
  String methodName=result.getMethod().getMethod().getMethodName();
   test.log(Status.pass,methodName" ----->passeed")
}
Now go to fail
onTestFailure()
{
   test.log(Status.Fail,result.getThrowable());
   or
   test.log(Status.log,methodName+"----->Fail");
}


=>Same do in onTestSkipped()



 
Note :
It shold be configured onStart() only because every time my suite started it shold execute

How to attach sceenShot in Report::

Make sceenshot method as return type mrthod by proideing getAbsolutepath()

Then that method we need to call in listner and store the path

String path=call the sceenshot method from Webdrivermanager in try block

test.addScreenCapturePath(path);


ITestResult:
It is an interface avilable in TestNG and it is used as an argument for every abstrct methods
in listner implementation class which will capture the pass/fail status of current test script
during run time..
Reports :
It is very impotatnt part of framework because they act like proof for all the excution
done by automation tester.

Customer usually ask for excution report and also fro devlopers

Usually after every excution reports will be sent to  Product owner,leads,Tecnical
Consultant and customers...
-->There are two types of reports::
 -High Level Reports:  
    TestNG supports HTML report which provides basic information  likeTotal number of
     test Script excuted ,Number of test script passed /failed/Skipped
   Low Level Reports:This specify the log level analysis in testNG we have Reporter.log();
     -  
Different log levels:
-INFO-which will give information
-WARNING-warning
-ERROR-issue
-FATAL-issue

->Disadvantage of html report in testNG:
 ->No pie chart representaion
 ->Non customisable
 ->Cannot attach scrrenshot
 ->very Simple reprting format

So to overcome these drawback we use EXTENT REPORTS or ALLURE REPORTS

=>EXTENT Report:
  It is  a popular reporting format used i several companies as it given graphical
  representation  of high level report
  It has 3 major classes
  ->ExtentSparkReporter->used to set the basic configuration for report
  ->ExtentReports->Its a main class which will set system information to the report
  ->ExtetetTest->This class will perform test script analysis
 
 ->Extent reports can be configured in BaseClass or ListnerImplementation class of 
    genericUtility package in framework,most prefered is ListnerImplementation class
    because it monitors the excution...
    flush should be mendatory to be used it will consolidate all test excution status  
    and generate the report.  


IRtryAnalyser in TestNG:
->It is a interfasce present in TestNG, which will rerun the failed test script
->Sometimes failure can be due to sunachronisation issue , nerwork issue,server issues
     or any missalneious issue,and if we run the test script 3-4 times the
script will execute and might pass..

->For such type of issues we will analyse is manually,if passed only then for next execution
will implwmwnt retryAnalyser...

Question-
1-Should we provide listneres to every class?
  Yes

2-Should we provide retryAnalyser fro every class ?

NO


Ques-Why We go for listners?
Because it is used to monitor every trstScript and 
based on the events  we can perform necessary action based
on abstract class
ITestListerner 

->We can capture run time events
->We can configure extent reports
->It provides inbult methods to log tht status of test script..

Why we have take ScreenShots?
Sceenshot acts as proof yo the devloper for rising defect/bug
Debugging becomes easy with scrrenshots
It can be shared across with devlopers and other tester for easy
communication of the issue..

Ques-Out of 1000 TC there were 200 TC failed so how you will
  only run the failed testCases...

In Project-> Test Output folder ->testng-.failed.xml
This suite xml will consist of failed test script in the current excution
and it is autoupdated,it we run the suite it will excute.

Ques->Out of 1000 test script ,200 test script got failded ,What is your approch?
->Check the excution steps 
->Rerun the failed test script to analyse the issue like 
->Put break point and run  the individuales test script in debug mode..
->if it is a test script issue -correcr and update the framework
->If it is a product issue ->rise it as a bug


Maven:
It is build integration tool,build testing tool,Build Dependency tool

Maven is tool which is used  for build managment  instead oh ANT and D=GRADEL

Why Maven Devlopemnt?
->In case of devlopment Maven is build process tool (Build Creation,Build Testing and Build Deployment)..

Various Build commands used for these Build related actionss..

Process of cinverting source code into any executable format?
->mvn Package si used
 
Since multiple ATE will be working in a project,so we have to test the project for compilation issue and also we
check the build is broken or not?
->mvn compile

Build Deployment process:
Initiating the build in teting server or any other environment ->We use mvn Deply,mvn install

Why Maven is used in Automation testing?
It is used for testing the application with currrent recent framework by executing the script...
When multiple automation tester are working with current framefork then there  might be canges maid by automatin test engg..
might affect entire framework to ovecome this we go for mavaen build life cycle...

Commands of mvn life Cycle
->mvn clean
->mvn validate  ->It will check all the jars are downloaded for the dependencies or not if not it will download..
->mvn compilation->It will check the compilation issues
->mvn test

->mvn test also does all the jobs but we can check individually the perticular test Cases

Now if I want to run perticular class in mvn command prom?

Yes we can run specific class mvn -Dtest=className test
  -D statands for data and we need to provide key and value 
    -Dkey=Value ->-D should end with test...Couple of times it will miss if it is not ended with test
It will navigate to project location compare all the test cases name with name given in command if its matching it will execute
If we want to run multiple specific classes:::
-Dtest=className,className1 test

Can We execute more then one class?
Yes we can execute by comma seperated
  -Dtest=className,className1 test

Can we Run the spscific method inside perticular class?
 mvn -Dtest=OrganisationTest#createOrgTest test



Software in Maven :
Maven ecllipse plug in
Maven command line plugin

When We create the new mvn Project then:
Group ID->Company/Organisation name
Artifact ID->Project Name

What is pom.xml->Project Object model or Project configuration file


Note:
@Test when we write in test Cases then we save every test cases with _ _  _ _ Test.java
So that no test cases are skipped when we write mvn test



Ques:
Why we have to read the data from command Line?
=>Simetimes we can get the situation that tht customer have to excute the test script with differnt browser or
     in differt enviromnet or with different credentials,sice customer can not go and make chnages in framework then
     we provide the option in the framework to accept the run time parameter  so that we can pass the data using maven Parameter.

=>In a same class if we want to execute the perticular test methods?
  


Practise th cmd prom commands Randomly?

=>SureFirePlugin
  If we want ro run any suite file with command prom then we will go for sureFire plugin 

When we will add surefire plugin in pom.xml then when we will run mvn from cmd from the first surefire will execute...

Advantage of it will be that if any testcsript will  not have test is last then also it will excute.. 
->hence to load testng.xml file we make use of plugin is called Surefire plugin..

Note::
In a testNg.xml file every time it is not the good approch to update the <suitexmlfiles> </suitexmlfiles> in surefire
plugins because it may coruptthe project so to overcome this drawback we need to go with Maven Profiling.

Maven Profling
<profile>
<id>ReginalSmoke</id>
//And paste the sure fier plugin with the updated maping in <suitexmlfiles>
</profile> 


Now to execute these profiles in command prom we will write mvn test -p id_Name_Provided




Git:

1-commit:-It will copy the framework from working directory to local repositary..

2-push:It will copy the framework from local repositary to the global repositary or .git folder to github global
             repositary with url and username and password/Token

3-Clone:When we want to pull the project we need to clone th repositary by provideing proper username and
               Token 
               To clone the repositary it repositary should be present in the Github account.

4-Pull-It will help us to get the changes pushed into the framework.We can use pull only if the project is existinging in the working
            directory ie..It should be already imported only imported project can be pulled..

Rules:
a->Project should be commited local repo first then it should be comitted to global repo..
b->To make any changes in project first we pull to local repositary from central repositary then it is imported
       tp working directory.

What is Git Conflict?
When two ATE wants to make changes in the same repositary at the same location the Git COnflict arises..

How to reslove the Git Conflict?
Pull the codefirst before pushing
Remove all the unwanted comments
Analyse the code pushed by others
If it is differt then push it




Jenkins:CI/CD Tool
 It is a continous integration tool ,continues Devlopment,Continues Deplyment and continues Delivery


Example 
Take facebook inilaty it has one feature i.e Friends msg...

Two devlopers were there one will be for manage friends and manage friends

Another person came as devops who made it as a build..

Now this build instaled in tesing server,now MTE will write the test case And ATE will write the Test Cases..

There is one more ENvrionment called as production..With production they are customer to acess..


Now UPDATE CAME
News Feer Pages update came
Now for this new module is integrated with old features 
Now whole appliction id given in build,Testing,Producion Enviroment.

Now any new source code is is done by the jenkins  

So when ever new update comes this jobs are created every time  so this is done by jenkins

That is why it is called continues Devlopment continues Deployment Continues Integration..

Automation Engg:
We will check the continues integration between the old feature  and the new feature  with old framework...


Why Jenkins is required in Automation?
ATE use jenkins for Continues INtegration..

Continues integration means checking the ingration issue between old build and 
the new feature by executing the old frame work.

If the test sxcript get failed then with the failure we will come to know
what is the impact of new feature on the old build..

Hence we analyse the failure ,debug the failled test script ,if any product
issue is found then we will raise it to JIRA,IF any TS issue the we will correct it... 

Jenkins Configuration..
Login to jenkins
DashBoard->Manage jenkins->Global Tool Configuration
                   ->Set path for jdk,git,MAven

=>Create Job in jenkins:
     ->Login to jenkins
      ->New Item->Name of job->Choose Maven Project
     ->Provide the git location where maven is stored
     ->Provide schule ->specify the pom.xml location inside the project 
     ->Root POM->specify the pom.xml location inside the project
     Goal->Default goal for tester in test
            ->All maven commands can be given like:
                ->test -P SmokeSuite
                ->-Dbrowser=Chrome -Dusername=Chaitra test
         Provide any post buiild action if needed        

=>Parameters in Jenkins:
    ->Jenkins also supports parameters but internally its maven parameter only
    ->We use $ specify jenkins parameter
    ->Choice parameters provide multiple choices for data that can be chosen during the execution..
    ->Using jenkins parameter in goal..
        -Dbrowser=$browser  -Dusername=Chaitra -Durl=$url test
      Here browser and action are used during build now action..
    
     Why jenkins parameter is required?
     Sometimes customer might want to execute the job with different browser or in different Environment
      ,Since customer will not make changes in framework,so we provide choice in parameters,so that it gives dropdown of
       different choices given like different browser name,different environment,customer can easily choose the drop down and execute 
       the job ..No coding Knowledge needed to run the job..

   =>Schedule job in jenkins:
        Scheduling decides when the job execution should be triggred or started
        There are three types of scheduling in jenkins 
         ->On Demend
             When ever the customer demands the executiom, we will trigger the execution
             with build now option available
          ->There is no exsimated time for execution,whwnever customer demands,we can run..
         ->Build nowis a action performed for ON demand scheduling

         ->On Schedule scheduling:
             Specify the exact time duration of when the execution should start is called on schedule scheduling
           ->While configurring the job only we have to provide  "build periodically" in build trigger..
             ->Jenkins Follow the specific Scheduling
              

             MINUTE  HOUR  DOM MONTH  DOW
              (0-59)      (0-23)  (1-31)   (1-12)    (0-7)
         


           ->ON Schedule does not bother if the framework is updated or not,it will start the execution immediately in the spscified
               time scheduling..

  =>Poll SCM
      ->It will detect the changesmade in specified git location(SCM-Source CODE Management)..
          It will start the execution in scheduled time..

        ->Here schedule is usually
        H * * * *->When ever any changes is detected like new oush/commit it will trigger the job
         ->When we make any chages is detected in push/commit it will trigger the job..or
             if its pushed into the branches then it has to be reviewed and merged into the master..
         ->Usually Master repo of thre framework will be configured with jenkins and if any new commit
             is recorginised,jenkins will start the execution based on scheduling..

       
How to Work with Broken links?

->A server generates HTTP status codes in response
to the request submitted  by client to server..
->A valid Url willl have a 2xx HTTP ststus code
->Broken links which are essentially invalid HTTP request will have 
ststus code as 4xx and 5xx status codes..


->Now we need to collect all the links on the webPage
->Send Http request for each link
->Varify the http response code
->Determine the link is broken based on HTTP 
    response code.
->Repete steps for all links
