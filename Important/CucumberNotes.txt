 _Cucumber:
It is BDD(Behavioral Driven Devlopment) or framrwork/tool which support BDD..

Different BDD tools avilabkle in market:
Like Cucumber there are many other tools to 
support BDD like 
SpecFlow,Behave,Jasmine(javaScript) etc

Cucumber support many programing language like:
Java,Python,.net,PHP,JavaScript etc...

Now Lets Compare BDD with Tradition devlopment..

Taditional Devlopment
From client side we get BRS
IT will ge given to devlopers and testers
In traditional Devlopment the communication is lagging
In traditional more focus of Devlopers an testers  is given to Architecture,Tools,Skills
Count of resources time Line ..
Since communication is laggig so may be chances are there built the wrong product

BDD: 
Here Cummunication is done in every stage with Business,Devlopers,Testers
Communicatio is possible with the help of .feature file

Lets See Feature File::

Feature: Search
Searching of various catagories should be possible along the product search..
 

Sceanari: Search for the product for Books catagory..
Using search funtinality.User must be able to search the books

Given I visited the website as Guest user
When I select the books option dropdown
And I click on the search Icon button
Then I should see the books Page loded
And I should see "Books at Amazon" as heading


How real time scenarios work?
So in real time we will have th Peopduct Owner who is goinf to understand th Curstomer requrement and that 
requirement he is going to covert it into UserStory.
Now UserStory is going to be given to Devlopers and testers
 Now tester and devloper are going to understant the userStory so they will try to and if they have any dought then
they ask from PO and Po will clarify their doughts....
Now according to the understanting Tester will write the feature file and devlopers will devlop the featutre funtinaly of an
application..
Now Testest will test the Funtinality by the feature file whic is approved by PO..

BDD Amigios?
There are three amigios of BDD->Bussiness,Devlopers,Tester
There are called as amigios beacuse they have a good comunication between them

In Cucmber we can prepare multiple .feature files and in feature file we write the scenarios......

Feature:User Login
Registerd user should be able to login acess acount detials..

Scenario:Login with valid credentials
Given user navigate to login page
 When user enters the valid email adress 
And Enters valid password 
And click on login button
Then User should login sucessfully

Scenario:Login with invalid credentials
Given user navigate to login page
When user enters the invalid email adress 
And Enters invalid password 
And click on login button
Then User should login sucessfully

Scenario:Login with valid emailAdress and invalid password
Given user navigate to login page
When user enters the email adress 
And Enters invalid password 
And click on login button
Then User should login sucessfully


Then we should go for StepDifinations

Now in real time we must have the Idea of stepDefination and .feature file so
try to create Manually.. 



@Given("^User navigates to Register Account Page$")
This is called as called as regular expression

This is called as Cucumber expression 
@Given("User enter firstName {string} and lastName {string}")

Note we can not have regular expression and Cucumber expression simultaniously

Feature: User Registraion

Scenario: Register with mendatory fields
Given Iser navigates to Register Account Page
When User Enters FirstName "Arun" into the first Name field
And Enters the lastName "Motoori" in the lastName Field
And Enters Email adress "xyz@gmail.com" into the Email field
And Enters telephone "12345643" into the Telephone field
And Enters password "12345" into the password foeld
And Enters password "12345" into the comfirm filed
And select privacy policy field
And Clicks on Continue button
Then Account should get Succed

Scenario: Register with all  mendatory fields
Given Iser navigates to Register Account Page
When User Enters FirstName "Arun" into the first Name field
And Enters the lastName "Motoori" in the lastName Field
And Enters Email adress "xyz@gmail.com" into the Email field
And Enters telephone "12345643" into the Telephone field
And Enters password "12345" into the password foeld
And Enters password "12345" into the comfirm filed
And select privacy policy field
And Clicks on Continue button
Then Account should get Succed

Scenario: Register without providing  mendatory fields
Given user navigates to Register Account Page
When User donot enter details into any fields
Then Warning messages should displayed for all mendatory fields

Now createl all StepDefinations manually
Note:
If we are giving any {String} then no need to provide the ^ and $ symbol..



Tidy Gherkin Plugin:
It is a plugin which is used to convert .feature file into step Defination:
This plugin we nned to add in browser only so to dwonload we need to go to google
and type Tidy gherkins plugin download
Then click on the first link
Then click in Add to chrome

How to run multiple feature file in one click:
It can be done be creating all .feature file, runner file ,stepdifination in one package and just write the code
@RunWith(Cucumber.class )

public class Runner {

}


How to use "Background" Gherkins Keyword?
In a .feature file if any step is common for every scenario then we can use Background keyword here..
It will be written on the top 
Background:
Given open the application
Advantage of it is that it will reduce the lines of code in .feature file

How ro use scenario outline and examples in gherkins keyword -Data driven testing?

How to generate html report ?
@RunWith(Cucumber.class )
@CucumberOptions(
		plugin = {"html:target/t1.html"}  
		
		)


public class Runner {

}

Regular Expression in Cucumber:
Regular expression is also called as Regex.
Regex are used to check weather search patter in avilable in the given String.
->  .*Raja.*
->String: Ny name is Raja Singh 
  	 public class Demo {
	
                                public static void main(String[] args) {
		boolean data=Pattern.matches(".*Raja.*","My name is Raja SIngh");
		System.out.println(data);
	}

}
//Conclusion ->The above class will check weather the regex is matching with Given String

Now Case 2:
 public class Demo {
	
                                public static void main(String[] args) {
		boolean data=Pattern.matches("Java","Java");//true
		boolean data=Pattern.matches("java","Java");//false
	
		System.out.println(data);
	}


//Conclusion:It is Case Sensative



Case3:
So if we are not sure weather it will be upper or lower case then we will go 
for[jJ]

public class Demo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		boolean data=Pattern.matches("[jJ]ava","Java");
		System.out.println(data);
	}

}

Case4:
So if we are not sure weather the perticular letter is upper
or lower then  we will go 
for ->[jJ]

public class Demo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		boolean data=Pattern.matches("Ye[sp]","Yes");//True
		System.out.println(data);
	}

}

Case5:
. can be any thing
//Since only one . is there so only one charecter can be any thing
public class Demo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		boolean data=Pattern.matches(".es","Yes");//True
                                  boolean data=Pattern.matches(".es","sdffdes");//false

		System.out.println(data);
	}

}

Case6:

public class Demo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		boolean data=Pattern.matches("[0-9]es","5es");//True
                                  boolean data=Pattern.matches(".es","sdffdes");//false

		System.out.println(data);
	}

}
//In the above number it be any thing from 0 to 9..
//Same way lower alphabet and upper alphabet



Case6:
boolean data=Pattern.matches("[0-9A-Za-z]es","5es");//True
The first letter can be any thing from 0 to 9 or A to Z or a to z

Case7
  boolean data=Pattern.matches("[^0-9]es","5es");//True
  Except 0 to 9 it can be any thing
Case8:
  boolean data=Pattern.matches("Y[^aeiou]s","Yes");//True
   The middle later must not be part of aeiou                                                            
Case9
     boolean data=Pattern.matches("//dam","5am");//True
    //d means number is from 0-9
   same way id I give
   //D means except 0-9

Case10
boolean data=Pattern.matches("[0-9A-Za-z_]es","5es");//True
Here I given _means it will match with  '_' also
So intead of this [0-9A-Za-z_] we can write [\\w]

Case 11
boolean data=Pattern.matches("My","My name is Abhi Singh");//False
boolean data=Pattern.matches("My","My");//True
boolean data=Pattern.matches("^My.*","My name is Abhi Singh");//True .* means   any number of Charecters
Here ^ means starts with My

Case 12
boolean data=Pattern.matches("Singh$","My name is Abhi Singh");//False
boolean data=Pattern.matches("Singh","Singh");//True
boolean data=Pattern.matches(".*Singh$","My name is Abhi Singh");//True .* means   any number of Charecters
Here & means it is ending with Singh


Case13:
     ^My.*Arun
     boolean data=Pattern.matches("^My.*Arun","MyAbhi");//True
   But insted of this if I give .+ then It means minimum one charecter must be there
     boolean data=Pattern.matches("^My.+Arun","MyAbhi");//false
    boolean data=Pattern.matches("^My.+Arun","My Abhi");//True


Case14:
   If I use .? means it must be repeted 0 numer of times


Cucumber  Expression:
@When("User enters firstname { } into the First Name field") ->it can take any thing
@When("User enters firstname { String} into the First Name field")
@When("User enters firstname {word } into the First Name field")
@When(" I scored {int} runs")



Can we use Cucumber exprssion and Regular Expression together or not?
No we can not use Cucumber and regular expressio simultainusly

When we get DubliCate StepDefination Exception?
Note
In a project if we have n number of feature file then same step can be written only in one time if we write 
same step in different feature file it will provide the exception So keep in mind step step can not be
dublicate

When we get dublicate AmbiguousStepDefinationException?
Thes exception is arised when there are two feature files are present  the step are same  in which one expression we are using 
regular exception and another we use cucumber expresion.

How to use comment section in Cucumber feature file?
We can use # sysmbol for the cumment section in .feature file


Tags in Cucumber:



@all
Feature
@smoke  @regression @FT
Scenario:Login with valid credentials
Given user navigate to login page
When user enters the valid email adress 
And Enters valid password 
And click on login button
Then User should login sucessfully
@FT
Scenario:Login with invalid credentials
Given user navigate to login page
When user enters the invalid email adress 
And Enters invalid password 
And click on login button
Then User should login sucessfully
@FT
Scenario:Login with valid emailAdress and invalid password
Given user navigate to login page
When user enters the email adress 
And Enters invalid password 
And click on login button
Then User should login sucessfully

case1:
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
	
		features = "D:\\RestAssuredOnline\\MavenCucmber\\src\\test\\java\\feature\\hooksFile.feature",
		
		glue = "stepDefination",
		
		tags = "@all"
)

public class RunnerClass {

}
//In this if we add @all in .feature file abive the Feature  then we will can print all the Scenario...
//In tags we can also use 'or' means executing this and that  both..
    tags="@smoke" or "@sanity" 

//In tags we can also use 'and' means executing if both tags are there..
    tags="@smoke" and "@sanity" 

//In tags we can also use 'not' means except that perticular execute all
    tags= "not @sanity" 

note:We can use and,not,or simultaniusly.

Hooks in Cucumber:
There are mainly two hooks in cucumber
@Before
@After
Note:
In industry we use tearDown which means close the browser



How to use Tagged Hooks in Cucumber..
In this we can use both tags and hooks simultanuisly.

@Before(@register)
public void setup()
{
   Sopln("Browser got opened")
}
@After(@register)
{
  Sopln("Browser got closed.")
}

The above will only run with @Before  and @After   ->@resgister tag







@BeforeStep an @AfterStep

How to use @BefterStep an @AfterStep in Cucumber?
If we write @BeforeStep and @AfterStep then it is going to execute in each and every steps of of every sceanario which
is present in that .feature file...


@BeforeStep("@Smoke")
@AfterStep("@Smoke")
Then is will only execute with that perticular scenario where @smoke tag is avilable..

Multiple  Hooks and there Order:
Here we will use 
@Before(order=0)
@Before(order=1)
@Before(order=2)
@After(order=1)
@After(order=2)
@After(order=0)

Hooks with value Attribute:
@Before("@smoke")
@After("@smoke")
Then is will only execute with that perticular scenario where @smoke tag is avilable..
 
Now we are using order and value attribute simultaniusly then we will use
@Before(order=0,value="@smoke")
@After(order=0,value="@smoke")

DataTable in Cucumber:
Feature: 

  Scenario: 
    Given Register Page must be opened
    When Fill the Credential with DataTable
      | FN   | RRR           |
      | LN   | SSS           |
      | MAIL | xaa.gmail.com |
    Then Registes data must be created


package stepDifination;

import java.util.Map;

import org.testng.Reporter;

import io.cucumber.datatable.DataTable;
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
import io.cucumber.java.en.Then;
import io.cucumber.java.en.When;

public class DataTable1 {
	

@Given("Register Page must be opened")
public void register_page_must_be_opened() {
 
	Reporter.log("Data is logined",true);

}

@When("Fill the Credential with DataTable")
public void fill_the_credential_with_data_table(DataTable dataTable) {
	
	     Map<String, String> data = dataTable.asMap(String.class,String.class);
	        String d= data.get("FN");
	        System.out.println("++++++++++++"+d);
	
  
}

@Then("Registes data must be created")
public void registes_data_must_be_created() {
   
	Reporter.log("Register page created",true);
}

}


Note:
It is agood practise to keep .feature file in src/test/resouces

Running Cucumber Tests using Maven (Cucumber BDD - Part 37)
We can execure the project of maven if any class is ending with Test.
So to run this we reqire sure rie plugin.. 


Running Cucumber by using command line and overriding it.
In cucumber when we write mvn test in cmd line then all test ending  class will execute
                                               ----------
->Same way if we want to excute bperticular feature file and in that perticular tags then we will write..
   
   mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@smoke" 
   
Default tags in Cucumber:
There are two Types in Cucumber:
Custom Tags
Default Tags
Cuctom and Default tags both are user defined tags 
But Default tags we can say we can make it as a industry statndard which are most comenly used there..
@dev
@ignore
@wip
The above tags we can give our names but these names are given as per company statandards....

@dev
We write @dev  with any of the scenario when scenario is written with testrer end but it is not devloped with
Devloper end.. 
@ignore:
If any scenario do not want to execute
@wip 
We use this when devlopers are devloped the cide but tester has not executed 

tags ="@all and not @dev and @wip and not ignore"
It will execute all except this

How to retrive scenario names into hooks:

@RunWith(Cucumber.class )
@CucumberOptions(
		plugin = {"html:target/t1.html"},
		features = "./src/main/java/featurePackage",
		glue = {"hooksPackage","stepDefination"}
		
		
		)

Hooks will be added with every scenario...

Hot to run json and xml report?
The best report is .html only we are goig for it just for extra knowledge

@RunWith(Cucumber.class )
@CucumberOptions(
		plugin = {"html:target/t1.html",
				  "json:target/t2.json",
				  "junit:target/t3.xml"
				 
		},
		features = "./src/main/java/featurePackage",
		glue = {"hooksPackage","stepDefination"}
		
		
		)

Note:
In maven we get classNot found Exception then we must update the Project...



What is dryRun =true?
It is provided in cucumber options we go for this to to check the implementaion of all steps implementation
is there ot not, if any implementation is not there then it will not execute... 


How to publish the report in cloud?

@RunWith(Cucumber.class )
@CucumberOptions(
		publish = true,
		plugin = {"html:target/t1.html","pretty"},
		features = "D:\\Personal1\\FoxCucu\\src\\main\\java\\featurePackage\\Login.feature",
		glue = "stepDefination",
		monochrome = true
		
		
		
		
		)


How to perform parallel execution in Cucumber?
There are two ways by using 
TestNG
JUnit
The basic difference between testNG and Junit is that,TestNG will run all the scenarios paralley whereas Junit will
run .feature file parallel mode..
