Challenges faced in Testing::::::::

In my project One time I got a bug then devloper was not accepting the bug then I prepared the proper document
then We had a meeting with devloper and TL then issue resilved.
 
In one test cases I got a inconsistent bug it was changing every time.Then it was very diffecult to show me..
Then I have taken executed the same testcase multiple times and took the sceenshot of all the scenario and shown 
them to devlopers..
